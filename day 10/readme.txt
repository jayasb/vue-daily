Day 10

Today, we are going to install vue devtools
this makes debugging Vue applications much easier.

Link to install the plugin

Next we are going to add sorting to our table
In our original table, we didn't have indicator icons on the header

copy MyTable.vue to the views folder
Fields and Items array have been split
Fields - more control over each column if it is sortable or not

Nothing major - plain and simple
