Day 11

Today, we are going to fix the table so that we can fetch data dynamically

From command prompt - install axios
npm install axios --save

copy MyTable.vue to the views folder
fields array has been updated to accomodate the new fields
Items point to a function "myProvider"

myProvider has the axios implementation

Once you have the app working - click on the column header
Is sort broken?
Check on debugger - network tab
