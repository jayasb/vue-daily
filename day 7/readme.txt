Day 7

Now that we got a basic site up and running, next step is to sort out the build and deployment process.
Who wants to do stuff manually - I hate donkey work.

We are going to use Netlify
Why? - because it is super easy (moreover we want to get this done in less than 15 minutes)
you can read about it here

Setup is straight forward

All said and done, we connected the project in Github with Netlify
any changes that are committed get deployed automatically.
The site is on https as well.

I am sweating already - completed a lot today!
